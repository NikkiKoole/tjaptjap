   A timeline is for changing properties over time.

   Currently I imagine 2 ways of creating it;
   1) keyframes and inbetween tweens
   2) recording user input


     1 2 3 4 5 .

   However, when i would start with the recording one i dont need the UI as much
   It'll just be way too many keyframes. (60 fps of data input)


   For the recording one I need a big record button [SPACE]
   and probably a nice and big vertical slider to pan around in the result
