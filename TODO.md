- triangle_colors = { <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1>, { 0, 255, 0 }, <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1>, <table 1> },
  dont know who sets triangel_Colors to this, but its broken.

- use what we have now to experiment with flux and find issues

- some ui that shows nested parent-child relations

- duplicate (not really) the coloring function from polygon to smartlines
- moving multiple vertices with one pointer in polymode
- make a mesh per thing
- nested scene graph logic.

- reintroduce the parallax scrolling on z
- add random polygons a generator with some params
- keyframe animation
- live recording animation
- movie mode; rotations, ?line coords?, ?vertices?
