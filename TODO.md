interactivemovie L180 local button = Hammer:rectangle( "poly-handle"..i.."__"..j, 30, 30, {x=cx2-15, y=cy2-15, color=color})
whn you mess up those IDs (use ..i without the j ) the result is quite cool, mayeb use it as a feature ?

- imnagine a way when you press space you click a frame and do something nice with those frames, tween from one to another
  you want to save the diff somehow, so you know which properties to tween

- make it possible to remove all triangle colors and all vertex colors
- some ui that shows nested parent-child relations

- use what we have now to experiment with flux and find issues


- duplicate (not really) the coloring function from polygon to smartlines
- moving multiple vertices with one pointer in polymode
- make a mesh per thing
- nested scene graph logic.

- reintroduce the parallax scrolling on z
- add random polygons generator with some params maybe move the rect, srect, circle, star into that
- keyframe animation
- live recording animation
- movie mode; rotations, ?line coords?, ?vertices?
- You need a way to optionally close polygons.
